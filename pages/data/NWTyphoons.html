                            <h2>Overview</h2>
							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>Typhoons, Cyclones, Hurricanes.. <br>
                                However you call it, they will always be a  threat to livelihood and human lives. The NW Pacific Basin produces on average 26 storms per year making it the most active region for typhoons. <br>
                                In this dashboard I created, Let's explore all the storms that have ever hit this area. We will try to identify patterns in terms of storm frequency, pressure and the destruction they have caused. </p>
                            
							<h3>Scope</h3>
							<p>This dashboard includes all storm tracking data from 1980 to 2022. Only storms that were formed on the Northwestern Pacific basin are included. To be specific, the NW Pacific basin is the area in the Northern Hemisphere (Latitude > 0°) and with Latitude between 100° - 180°.
							</p>

                            <h2>How to use the dashboard</h2>

                            <p>The dashboard is divided into <b>3</b> different views: By Year, Patterns, and Impacts</p>
                            
                            <h3>By Year</h3>
                            <p>The <b>By Year</b> view displays a map showing typhoon tracking data and strength for a specified Pacific Typhoon Season. The typhoon season is selected on a dropdown on the upper-left side of the map, below which contains the names of all storms that hit that year. Each name, when clicked, will display the track of ONLY the selected storm.</p>
                            
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="../../images/typhoon_dashboard_byView.png" alt="" /></span>
                            
							<p>On the left sidebar, more details can be seen about the selected Typhoon season/year. Number of Storms, Max Storm Strength and Lowest Pressure are included as well as a ranked bar chart of strongest typhoons that year. A monthly breakdown is also included to show # of typhoons per month.</p>

                            <p>The main area contains a map which shows the track of all the storms on the selected typhoon season, OR a selected storm name. Each dot on the track represents the location of the storm per day and is colored according to the storm's strength. Each storm path is also labeled with the storm's name. When cursor is hovered on one of the dots, the speed of storm (in knots) at said location is also displayed. </p>

                            <p>At the bottom of the map, is an overall breakdown of # of typhoons per typhoon season/year.</p>

							<!-- BY YEAR VIEW -->
							<h3>Patterns</h3>
							<p>The 'Patterns' view shows each of the following: </p>
							<ul>
                                <li><b>How many expect per Month:</b> # of storms that hit per month. It is further breakdown according to category (based on Saffir-Simpson scale)</li>
                                <li><b>Where do they form?:</b> A map highlighting the areas according on the # of storms that have formed.</li>
                                <li><b>Pressure to Wind Speed Correlation: </b> A scatter plot showing correlation between Pressure and Wind Speed</li>
								<li><b>Throughout the Years: </b> A bar chart showing number of typhoons per year and further breakdown by the maximum category of each storm (based on Saffir-Simpson Scale). It is overlayed with a line chart showing the max wind speed reached per year.</li>
								<li><b>Areas likely to be hit: </b> shows 4 heatmaps (one for each quarter) showing areas that have been within range of a storm.</li>
                            </ul>


							<h2>Implementation</h2>

                            <h3>Data Sources</h3>

                            <h4>Storm Meteorological Data</h4>
							<p>The data used in this dashboard is obtained from the <b><i><a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive">International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS)</a></i></b> project. Their website contains the most complete global collection of tropical storms available. Also, it's completely available to the public. </p>

                            <p>For this dashboard, I used the IBTrACS Version 4 which was their latest version.</p>


                            <h4>Storm Impact</h4>
                            <p>Although, the IBTrACS data is large dataset, it still does not have data for the # of deaths and damages each storm caused. After a little bit of research, I found many sources to have different numbers and most of these numbers are not in an organized form and rather, they are nested within articles which makes it very inefficient to look into each storm on record and read all the articles related to each. I expected each countries government agencies to have the data but I can't seem to find organized data form their websites. </p>
                            <p>An efficient, though unreliable solution would be to use Wikipedia. Suprisingly, they have an article for each typhoon season which include countries affected, # of deaths and resulting damages in USD. I decided then to utilize it for the lack of better data source. Here is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Pacific_typhoon_season#Season_effects">NW Pacific Typhoon Season article </a>.</p>

							<h3>Data Extraction and Transformation</h3>
                            <h4>IBTrACS Dataset</h4>
							<p>The IBTrACS data can be downloaded on a csv format which I preferred since it's easier to manage. The fields used in the dataset are described in their <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/IBTrACS_v04_column_documentation.pdf">Column Documentation</a>. The dataset is opened with MS Excel. Data is then filtered to only include rows whose <code>BASIN</code> field has a value of <code>WP</code> which represents Western North Pacific.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h4>Damages and Deaths Data from Wikipedia</h4>
							<p>To minimize effort in going through each wikipedia article, I created a script which automates extraction of data. The script iterates through each year from 1980 to 2022 and goes to the URL of each article determined by the pattern: <code>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<b>{YEAR}</b>_Pacific_typhoon_season#Season_effects</code>. The script was left to run and finished within 5 mins.</p>
							<p>The resulting data was exported to an excel file. The data is then cleaned and transformed so that each row represents one storm-area combination. It is further transformed to include a new column which identifies the country of each area. Example: data from wikipedia includes 'Bonin Islands' as an affected area by Typhoon Malakas in 2022. By looking it up, the area is identified to be within jurisdiction of Japan. Thus, all 'Bonin Islands' will have the value 'Japan' in the <code>country</code> field.</p>

							<h4>Join IBTrACS and Wikipedia data</h4>

                            <h3>Dashboard Creation</h3>
							<p>The dashboard was created using Tableau Public v2023.3. No further data transformations were applied. Output Data from 'Data Preparation' was used directly by the dashboard.</p>
